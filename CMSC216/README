These are my C Projects in my CMSC216 class for UMD, I have permission from the professor to share this code on my resume and for potential employers,
PLEASE DO NOT SHARE THIS CODE!!!! It must remain private.
All of these projects were conducted in a shell and Linux environment.
Each project and exercise has a brief description of it, please read them to understand the project.
For some of them, I did not upload all of the files because some of the files were not written by me, but instead by the professor, and that would be copyright to
include, so I just put the code I wrote.
