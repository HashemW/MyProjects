I have played so much Hearts of Iron 4 since I was in middle school. I love this game so much that I have made my own mod and temporarily worked with the team
that upholds a mod with 600,000 downloads (called The Road to 56). My mod was called Arabia and it was an alternate history if the sykes picot never happened (nerd
stuff I know), but I have linked the mod page, it had almost 2000 downloads at its peak, and I just re updated it. Much of the code is specific to the clausewitz engine
of the game, so it may not be understandable, but it was a mighty endeavor.
