# MyProjects
UMD CS Projects, MATLAB,  etc
These are a collection of my projects, I would have loved to include my CS projects from my Java courses, but the professor believes it is copyright infringement so I cannot upload them, however I have some others:
- Old Matlab projects from my Linear Algebra (allowed my the professor)
- Unreal Engine Projects (only the code)
- My C Projects from UMD course (also allowed by the professor)
- other projects.
