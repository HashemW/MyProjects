These are all my projects from my Linear Algebra class in UMD from MATLAB (MATH240)
They are organized in such a way :
- First, the assignment directions for each problem is the first part of each pdf.
- The second part of the pdf is my MATLAB code/results.
There are some problems which I would like to disclose.
1. The first Matlab project asks me to write the linear combination for #4, which I did not do.
2. For Project 3 Question 1, the first question I put the answer in incorrect parametric vector form.
3. For Project 3 Question 2d, 2d is just simply incorrect.
Everything else should be fine.
